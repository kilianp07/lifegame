 # Package model

This package contains the definition of the User struct and its methods, including the `Hash()` function that is tested in this file.

## User Struct

The `User` struct represents a user account with a password.

```go
type User struct {
	Password string
}
```

### Password field

The `Password` field stores the user's clear-text password.

## Hash Function

The `Hash()` function hashes the user's password using an unspecified hashing algorithm. The hashed password is stored back in the `User` struct.

```go
func (u *User) Hash() error {
	// Hashing algorithm implementation omitted for brevity.
	// ...
}
```

## Testing User Hash

The file contains a test function named `TestUserHash` which tests the `Hash()` function by creating a new `User` instance, hashing its password, and verifying that the original password is no longer equal to the hashed password.

```go
func TestUserHash(t *testing.T) {
	const password = "password123"

	user := &User{
		Password: password,
	}

	err := user.Hash()
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	assert.NotEmpty(t, user.Password)

	if password == user.Password {
		t.Errorf("Hashed password is not different from original password")
	}
}
```

### Testing Framework

This file uses the `stretchr/testify` testing framework for assertions and test failures. The `assert.NoError()` and `assert.NotEmpty()` functions are used to check that the `Hash()` function does not return an error and that the hashed password is not empty, respectively. If these conditions fail, the test will produce a failure message.

### Test Case Description

The test case initializes a new `User` instance with the password "password123", hashes its password using the `Hash()` function, and verifies that the original password is not equal to the hashed password. This test checks that the `Hash()` function modifies the user's password correctly, ensuring that it creates a hashed version of the password that should be different from the clear-text password.
