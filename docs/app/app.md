 # App Package Documentation

This package `app` is the main application package for a Life Game program written in Go. It imports necessary packages and constants, initializes an `App` struct, and defines functions to start and configure the application.

## Imported Packages
- `fmt`: For formatted I/O operations
- `github.com/c-bata/go-prompt`: For implementing a prompt for user input
- `github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/app/game`: For game related functionality
- `github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/app/register`: For user registration
- `github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/config`: For application configuration
- `github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/database`: For database related functionality

## Constants
The package defines several constants for various actions:
- `REGISTER`: To register a new user
- `PLAY`: To start playing the game
- `RULES`: To display rules of the game
- `EXIT`: To exit the application

## App Struct and Functions
### App Struct
```go
type App struct {
	conf       *config.App
	controller *database.Controller
}
```
This `App` struct contains an application configuration object (`*config.App`) and a database controller (`*database.Controller`).

### NewApp Function
```go
func NewApp(conf *config.App) *App {
	return &App{
		conf: conf,
	}
}
```
This `NewApp` function initializes and returns a new instance of the `App` struct with the provided configuration object.

### Start Function
```go
func (a *App) Start() {
	// ...
}
```
The `Start` function is responsible for starting the application by prompting the user to select an action and executing the corresponding function based on the input until the user chooses to exit.

## Functions
### configure Function
```go
func (a *App) configure() error {
	// ...
}
```
The `configure` function initializes and sets up the database controller for use by the application.

### completer Function
```go
func (a *App) completer(d prompt.Document) []prompt.Suggest {
	// ...
}
```
The `completer` function provides autocompletion suggestions to the prompt for user input. It returns a list of suggestions based on the word before the cursor in the document.

### determineFunc Function
```go
func (a *App) determineFunc(s string) error {
	// ...
}
```
The `determineFunc` function determines and executes the corresponding action based on the user input. If an error occurs during execution, it is returned to be handled by the caller.
