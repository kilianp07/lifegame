 # App Package Documentation

This documentation describes the `app` package which is the entry point of the Lifegame application. The package imports various libraries and constants required for the application to function.

## Imports

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os/exec"

	"github.com/c-bata/go-prompt"
	"github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/app/game"
	"github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/app/register"
	"github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/chat/server"
	"github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/config"
	"github.com/kilianp07/lifegame/database"
)
```

The package imports the following libraries:

* `fmt` for formatted I/O
* `log` for logging errors
* `os/exec` for executing operating system commands
* The `go-prompt` library for creating a command line interface
* The `lifegame/app/game`, `lifegame/app/register`, `lifegame/chat/server`, `lifegame/config`, and `lifegame/database` packages that contain the game logic, user registration, chat server, configuration, and database controller respectively.

## Constants

```go
const (
	REGISTER = "register"
	PLAY     = "play"
	RULES    = "rules"
	CHAT     = "chat"
	EXIT     = "exit"
)
```

These constants define the names of various actions or functions that the application supports. They include `REGISTER`, `PLAY`, `RULES`, `CHAT`, and `EXIT`.

## App Structure

The package defines an `App` type which is used to represent the application instance.

```go
type App struct {
	conf       *config.App
	controller *database.Controller
}
```

An `App` instance has a `conf` field that holds the configuration of the application and a `controller` field that represents the database controller.

## Initialization and Configuration

The package defines a `NewApp` function which creates a new `App` instance.

```go
func NewApp(conf *config.App) *App {
	return &App{
		conf: conf,
	}
}
```

It initializes the application instance by setting its configuration and database controller.

The package also defines a `Start` function which is used to start the application. It prompts the user to select a table and calls the corresponding function based on their choice until they choose to exit. If an error occurs while determining the function for the selected table, the error is printed and the loop is exited.

```go
func (a *App) Start() {
	// ...
}
```

## Completer Function

The `completer` function provides autocompletion suggestions for the prompt based on the current input. It returns a list of suggestions filtered by the word before the cursor in the input document. The suggestions include options for creating a new user account, playing the game, reading the rules, and exiting the game.

```go
func (a *App) completer(d prompt.Document) []prompt.Suggest {
	// ...
}
```

## Determine Function

The `determineFunc` function takes a string as input and performs a specific action based on the value of the string. It returns an error if an error occurs during the execution of the action.

```go
func (a *App) determineFunc(s string) error {
	// ...
}
```

## Open Chat Function

The `openChat` function opens a web browser to display the chat interface based on the current operating system. It uses the `runtime.GOOS` constant to determine the operating system and executes the appropriate command to open the web browser. If an unsupported platform is detected, an error is returned.

```go
func (a *App) openChat() {
	// ...
}
```
