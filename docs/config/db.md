 # config Package Documentation

This package named `config` is designed to handle configuration management in a Go application. It primarily includes a single type called `DBConf`.

## DBConf Type

```go
type DBConf struct {
	DBPath string `json:"db_path"`
}
```

### Description

The `DBConf` type is a simple configuration object used to store the database path for the Go application. It has only one field named `DBPath`, which represents the physical location of the database file.

### Fields

1. **DBPath (string)**: The absolute path to the database file. This field is decorated with the JSON tag `json:"db_path"`, which helps during JSON marshalling and unmarshalling when dealing with configuration files in JSON format.

## Usage

To use this package, follow these steps:

1. Import it into your Go source file:

```go
import "path/to/config"
```

2. Instantiate the `DBConf` type:

```go
dbConf := config.DBConf{DBPath: "/path/to/database.db"}
```

3. Use the `DBConf` instance throughout your application as needed. For example, you could pass it to a function or constructor when initializing database connections:

```go
func InitDatabase(dbConf config.DBConf) error {
	// Your initialization logic here
}

initDatabase := InitDatabase(dbConf)
if err := initDatabase; err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```

This is a simple yet comprehensive markdown documentation for the `config` package, which includes a brief description of its purpose and usage, along with details about the `DBConf` type.
